<br>    -- Through free online resources and teaching SAT and ACT in school time <br/>
    
- Make the SAT more affordable
<br>    -- Fee waivers for students who come from low income families<br/>
   
- Make the SAT mandatory 
 <br>   -- To give all students the chance to do well on the test<br/>
 
- Participation rates statistics have to be looked at in conjunction with other statistics.
 <br>   -- E.g. look at the number of students who go onto successfully graduate College.<br/>
